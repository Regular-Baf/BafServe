An optimised, auto-updating modpack, for Fabric 1.18.2 servers.

I've been getting pretty tired of having to update all the mods I use on my server one by one. So I made this little pack.
As I use a Raspberry Pi 4 for my own server, this pack is intended to be highly optimised for low spec machines.
Feel free to fork or modify anything here, and I'm open to hearing out any mod suggestions anyone might have.

**None** of these mods are my own. I'm not smart enough for that. They're all just ones that I really like!
